The justices turned away Remington's appeal of a ruling by Connecticut's top court to let the lawsuit proceed despite a federal law that broadly shields firearms manufacturers from liability when their weapons are used in crimes. The lawsuit will move forward at a time of high passions in the United States over the issue of gun control.",

    "Summary": "[image 1: Hillary Clinton: I Want to Hug Meghan Markle After \u2018Racist\u2019 Abuse in Britain][1] SAMUEL CORUMHillary Clinton has said she wishes she could hug Meghan Markle as she accused the mainstream British media of participating in a cycle of abuse against her motivated by racism and sexism.The former first lady and presidential candidate was appearing on BBC radio in Britain to promote a new book she has written with her daughter, Chelsea, about \u201cgutsy\u201d women.Don\u2019t Expect Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s Media War to Simmer Down SoonHillary said the abuse she had suffered was \u201cheartbreaking and wrong\u201d and said she was in no doubt there was a racial element to the abuse she has endured since starting a relationship with Harry in 2016 and marrying him in 2018.Meghan and Harry have been outspoken in their criticism of the press: Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday after alleging the paper unlawfully published a private letter to her father, while the prince is bringing a separate case alleging phone-hacking.Asked to comment on her legal action, Chelsea Clinton said: \u201cWe each have to do what we think is the right thing for ourselves and in her case I would imagine for her son\u2026 I think absolutely there\u2019s a racist and a sexist element to what\u2019s going on here.\u201d Hillary added that \u201crace was clearly an element\u201d in some of the social-media backlash Meghan had faced since her relationship with the prince began in 2016, and that traditional media had amplified that. \u00a0\u201cTo think that some of your, what we would call mainstream media, actually allowed that to be printed in their pages, or amplified, was heartbreaking and wrong. \u201cShe is an amazing young woman, she has an incredible life story. She has stood up for herself, she has made her own way in the world. And then she falls in love, and he falls in love with her, and everybody should be celebrating that because it is a true love story.\u201cI feel as a mother I just want to put my arms around her. Oh my God, I want to hug her. I want to tell her to hang in there, don\u2019t let those bad guys get you down.\u201dClinton suggested that Meghan could employ \u201csome humor, some deflection\u201d to better cope with negative attention.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

    "Summary": "[image 1: Condoleezza Rice Calls Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine Involvement \u2018Deeply Troubling\u2019][1] Former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said Monday that reports detailing the involvement of President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani in the White House\u2019s Ukraine policy were \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d\u201cWhat I see right now troubles me. I see a state of conflict between the foreign policy professionals and someone who says he\u2019s acting on behalf of the president but frankly I don\u2019t know if that is the case,\u201d Rice said at a conference in Abu Dhabi. \u201cThis is just not a good thing. The world shouldn\u2019t get confusing messages from the United States of America.\u201dMultiple witnesses have alleged in house testimony that Giuliani conducted his own investigative work without regard for the administration\u2019s formal policy.William Taylor, the former top American diplomat in Ukraine, whose testimony was released last week, asserted\u00a0that Giuliani was actively undermining U.S. foreign policy.\u201cThe irregular channel seemed to focus on specific issues, specific cases, rather than the regular channel\u2019s focus on institution building,\u201d Taylor said, according to the transcript. \u201cSo the irregular channel, I think under the influence of Mr. Giuliani, wanted to focus on one or two specific cases, irrespective of whether it helped solve the corruption problem, fight the corruption problem.\u201dEarlier Monday, news broke that Lev Parnas, an associate of Giuliani, will tell investigators that Giuliani attempted to leverage an official visit from Vice President Mike Pence to coax Ukraine into announcing an investigation into Joe Biden's son Hunter's business connections to Burisma.Rice also said she thought Trump\u2019s mention of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma, during the call was \u201cout of bounds.\u201d\u201cThe call is murky, it is really murky. I don\u2019t like for the president of the United States to mention an American citizen for investigation to a foreign leader,\u201d Rice said.",
